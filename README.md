# Threestacks

## Introduction

This little program calculates the number of possibilities of dividing some balls into some boxes.

Also a test field for me to practise aotutools, gettext, vim, and so on.

## Requirements

You will have `autotools`, `make`, `gcc` installed.

## Build

run these command in order:
	autoreconf
	./configure
	make

That should generate a binary file. Type `ts --help` for syntax and other help.
