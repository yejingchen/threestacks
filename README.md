# Threestacks

## Introduction

This little program calculates the number of possibilities of dividing some balls into some boxes.

Also a test field for me to practice `autotools`, `gettext`, `vim`, and so on.

## Requirements

You will have `autotools`, `make`, `gcc` installed.

## Build

Run these command in order:

> `autoreconf`
>
> `./configure`
>
> `make all`

That should generate a binary file under `src/`. Type `ts --help` for syntax and other help.
